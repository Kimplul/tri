# `tri`

This repository contains some basic tools for experimentation with my trinary
instruction set architecture.

# `core`

Central things related to trinary arithmetic, register naming and instruction
encoding/decoding.

# `tasm`

Trinary assembler.

# `tdump`

Trinary `objdump`

# `triscv`

Trinary ISA simulator.

# `utf9`

Helper stuff related to trinary text handling, effectively encodes UTF-8 as
trinary numbers.
